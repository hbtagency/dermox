Custom Banners provides a simple interface to upload several banners and show a random or specific one to each visitor, using a shortcode.

== Description ==
Custom Banners is a WordPress plugin that allows you to easily manage several banners (ads) and display them on the front end.

= Upgrade to Pro for For Advanced Features and Support =

The GoldPlugins team does not provide direct support for the Custom Banners plugin on the WordPress.org forums. One on one email support is available to people who have purchased Custom Banners Pro only. Custom Banners adds the ability to create slideshows from your banners, and it supports all kind of cool transitions. You should [upgrade today!](http://goldplugins.com/our-plugins/custom-banners/upgrade-to-custom-banners-pro/?utm_source=wp&utm_campaign=desc_upgrade1 "Upgrade to Custom Banners Pro")

[Upgrade To Custom Banners Pro](http://goldplugins.com/our-plugins/custom-banners/upgrade-to-custom-banners-pro/?utm_source=wp&utm_campaign=desc_upgrade2)

**Create Banners Once, and Reuse Them Throughout Your Website**

Use custom banners to create resuable banners that your whole team can use! Setup the banners once, and you'll be able to re-use them throughout the website. Best of all, if you need to make an update you can just make it once.

**Update Your Banners Without Touching Your Code**

Simply place a shortcode into the page where you'd like your banner to appear, and then you'll never have to edit that page again!  Custom Banners is also implemented as an easy-to-use Widget!

Instead, you'll be able to manage that banner right from the WordPress dashboard, uploading new banners and taking down old ones as you like. All without having to edit your pages.

**Easily Add Captions and Call-To-Action Buttons To Your Custom Banners**

Custom Banners lets you optionally specify a caption and a call-to-action text and URL for each banner, making your banners an effective way to drive visitors to your most important pages.  Captions support all types of content, including YouTube videos!

Use the captions to announce a new special, and use the call-to-action button to let your customers claim it right away.

**With the Pro version, easily add Fading or Sliding banners throughout your site!**

**Rotate Between Several Banners with Banner Groups**

Custom Banners also gives you many options for rotating banners within a position. So you can specify several banners which belong to a Banner Group, and then the software will automatically rotate through the banners in the Banner Group. 

**Automatically Publish New Banners At A Specified Time**

Do you have a banner that's announcing a new special, but you want to hide it until the right time? No problem - with the Publish Time feature of Custom Banners you can setup your banner now, but not show it until the right time.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What should I do if I don't want a call to action button? =

Simply leave the call to action text field blank

= How do I link the entire Banner to the Target URL and not just the Call To Action Button? =

On the Options screen, check the box next to "Link Entire Banner".

= I want my banners viewable at their Permalinks, but I get a 404 message - what gives? =

Alright - all you need to do is go to Settings -> Permalinks and click the Save button.  This should take care of the issue!

= Help!  My banners are being cut off on the left / right / top / bottom! =

No worries!  This probably means the image you are using doesn't match the size of the area it is being displayed in.  Try resizing and cropping your image to fit the available area, and then upload it again!

= Ack! When I enabled my slideshow, my slides disappeared! = 

OK!  This usually happens when there isn't a default Height and Width set on your Basic Options, causing the dimensions to not be correctly set on your slides.  All you have to do is adjust the Default Banner Width and Default Banner Height to suit your needs!

= Yarg! In the Widget, I've set my Banner Height to Auto but a pixel value is still being used.  Why? =

Unless you are using the Use Image Tag option, the height of the banner will default to a pixel value to prevent the banner from having no height.
